/* Tips for Usage.
   Aimed to work with just the main campaign page gamelog. Leaving character screen game logs uninterupted for use. 
   When capturing with OBS just keep the campaign game log open on a tab, then use window capture and cropping with chroma key.
   This way you can still use regular character rolls like normal without seeing those pages games logs edited.

   Also found that when using it this way, if you right click in the page when in your campaign, followed by inspect elements
   and then moving the display so its around half inspect/regular the game log part expands a little bit further making it longer when capturing.
